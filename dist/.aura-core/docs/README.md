# AURA Core (Agentic Unified Reinforcement for Academics)

This pack introduces specialized agents, tasks, templates, checklists, and workflows for designing and delivering courses.

## Structure
- `agents/` — role definitions
- `tasks/` — executable task guides
- `templates/` — YAML/MD blueprints for documents
- `checklists/` — quality and accessibility criteria
- `workflows/` — orchestrated flows for planning and execution
- `docs/` — readme and generated outputs

## Quick Start
1. Orchestrator lists workflows: `/workflows`
2. Start planning: `/workflow-start course-planning`
3. After planning gate, run: `/workflow-start course-execution`

## Gate Policy
Gate decisions (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED) rely on **qa-education-gate.md**.
