# Elicitation Methods for Learning Design

## Expand / Contract for Audience
- Expand for novices (more examples, analogies); contract for experts (denser abstractions).
- Always restate **who** the audience is and what prior knowledge is assumed.

## Socratic Prompting & Self-Explanation
- Ask guiding questions that lead learners to articulate reasoning steps.
- Insert **self-explanation** prompts after examples and exercises.

## Worked → Faded Examples
- Full worked example → partially completed (learner fills steps) → independent problem.

## Errorful Learning (Productive Failure)
- Present common incorrect approaches; have learners diagnose and correct.

## Cognitive Load Checks
- Signal main idea; chunk content; offload visuals; avoid redundancy; pace activities.

## Risk & Edge-Case Elicitation
- What misconceptions could arise?
- Which steps typically confuse learners and why?
- What alternative representations can remove ambiguity?

## Multi-Persona Review
- Designer: outcomes & scaffolding
- Learning-Curve Specialist: pacing & ladders
- Assessment Architect: validity & reliability
- QA Educator: accessibility & inclusivity

## Creativity Boosters (Education)
- Analogical mapping (real-world parallels)
- “What-if” scenario variations
- Role-play perspectives (developer, PM, client)
- Constraint challenges (5 min, 2 slides, 1 example)
