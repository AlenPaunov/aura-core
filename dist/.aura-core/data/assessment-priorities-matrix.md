# Assessment Priorities Matrix

Prioritize by **learning outcome criticality**, **risk of misconception**, and **authenticity needs**.

## Priority Levels

### P0 — Critical (Must Assess)
- Safety/compliance/ethics outcomes
- Core skills that enable subsequent modules
- Frequently failed or high‑risk concepts
**Coverage**: L1 + L2 + L3 (and L4 if summative)

### P1 — High (Should Assess)
- Primary course outcomes; frequently used skills
**Coverage**: L1 + L2 (L3 if time allows)

### P2 — Medium (Nice to Assess)
- Supporting skills and nice‑to‑have depth
**Coverage**: L2 or L3 (smoke)

### P3 — Low (Opportunistic)
- Enrichment topics; rarely used features
**Coverage**: Optional L2; manual review

## Priority Adjustments
Increase priority when:
- Impacts >50% of learners’ success downstream
- High real‑world risk or external stakeholders depend on it
- Known history of confusion

Decrease priority when:
- Feature‑flagged/optional tracks
- Low usage and easy remediation
- Strong automated checks exist

## Execution Order
1. P0 first (fail fast on critical misconceptions)  
2. P1 next (core proficiency)  
3. P2 as time permits  
4. P3 opportunistically
