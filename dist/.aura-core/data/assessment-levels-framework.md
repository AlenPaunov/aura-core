# Assessment Levels Framework

Choose the **lowest effective level** to validate mastery while keeping feedback fast and frequent.

## Levels

### L1 — Micro‑Formative (Checks for Understanding)
**When**: After each concept or example  
**Forms**: 1–3 MCQ/short answers, confidence poll, quick code/read prediction  
**Goal**: Immediate feedback; surface misconceptions early  
**Turnaround**: Instant/automated

### L2 — Lesson‑Unit Assessment
**When**: End of lesson  
**Forms**: Small practical task, short quiz, reflection prompt  
**Goal**: Verify lesson objectives; feed into remediation/enrichment  
**Turnaround**: ≤24–48h

### L3 — Module‑Integration Assessment
**When**: After 2–4 lessons (module)  
**Forms**: Mini‑project, case study, scenario‑based task  
**Goal**: Integrate multiple skills; transfer to realistic context  
**Turnaround**: 48–96h

### L4 — Program E2E / Capstone
**When**: End of course/track  
**Forms**: Project with rubric, oral defense, live demo  
**Goal**: Authentic performance; holistic mastery evidence  
**Turnaround**: Scheduled review

## Selection Rules
- Favor **L1/L2** for fast feedback and momentum.
- Use **L3** for transfer & integration.
- Reserve **L4** for summative certification.

## Anti‑Patterns
- Using capstones to check basic syntax.
- Pure recall questions for higher‑order outcomes.
- No rubric on open‑ended tasks.
